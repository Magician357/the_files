I’m not very good at this, am I?
Writing lines read many times before.
Carefully tip-toeing along the boundary,
Keeping friends, and family, out of my world.
They don’t see what I do alone.
How I feel, think, or do.
Yet here I am today,
Waiting.
Wasting time.
Time I could use.
I could write a book,
Comprised of words and phrases
Uttered by many mouths other than mine.
I could read a book,
Dreamt by proactive people,
Written in a thousand languages other than mine,
Ils ont mis tout leur cœur et leur âme dans leur texte.
Yet here I am.
And here you are,
Taking the time to read.
To understand what I am saying.
What I am thinking,
What I am feeling.
Yet you know nothing.
And I know nothing.
I only know me, and the confined world I live in.
Confined to the ground, to this planet, to this solar system.
We can only dream of what we will do.
Yet here I am.
Typing meaningless words on a meaningless screen.
Confined to another world.
Confined to words already made.
Confined by what I can and cannot say.
Confined by my fear.
Yet here I am,
Writing,
For someone far away,
And here you are.
Wasting your time listening.
Farewell.
