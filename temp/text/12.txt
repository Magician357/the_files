This is a long one.
Writing, this horrible, terrible, long run on sentence, without stopping or starting, no periods, no end in sight, just words and words and words and no one knows when it will stop, because it is extremely long, and getting repetive and there are only so many words in the alphabet but this sentence keeps going on and on and on with words and words and words and words with no end in sight and no beginning in sight either with no real things to do except wait and read and keep reading until you reach the end of this sentence that goes on and on and on and on and has words and words and words and words and words.
