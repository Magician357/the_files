I feel like there are better ways to sort things. Why does azzzzzzzzzzz go before zaaaaaaaaaaa, even though the latter has more letters that are closer to the beginning.
To fix this, I have devised a new sorting algorithm or whatever.
Instead of just going alphabetically, we take all the letters in a word, convert them to numbers (a-z is 1-26), sum those up, and rank the words by using that.
I think that would be nice.
